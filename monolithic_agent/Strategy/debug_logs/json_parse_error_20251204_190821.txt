  "formatted_response": "## 🚀 Your Complete EMA Crossover Strategy Validation!\n\nFantastic! You've now provided a comprehensive strategy, including clear entry signals and robust exit conditions. This is a classic trend-following approach with explicit risk management parameters. Let's break it down:\n\n### ✅ What's Great About Your Strategy\n*   **Clear Entry Rules:** You've defined precise signals for both long (30 EMA crosses above 60 EMA) and short (30 EMA crosses below 60 EMA) entries. This makes the strategy easy to automate and follow.\n*   **Defined Risk Management:** Crucially, you've included an explicit **10-pip Stop Loss** and a **50-pip Take Profit** from your entry point for every trade. This is a great starting point for managing risk and reward.\n*   **Favorable Risk-Reward Ratio:** Your fixed 10-pip stop loss and 50-pip take profit implies a **1:5 risk-reward ratio**, which is excellent in theory. This means you only need a relatively low win rate to be profitable, provided it's achievable.\n*   **Simplicity:** The strategy is straightforward and uses widely understood indicators, making it easy to comprehend and implement.\n\n### 💡 Key Considerations & Next Steps\nWhile the strategy is now complete, here are some critical areas to refine and test for real-world viability:\n\n1.  **💰 Position Sizing (CRITICAL!)\n    *   Why:** This is the most significant missing piece. Without defining *how much* to trade, the strategy cannot be executed, and your risk management is incomplete.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a position sizing rule. A common approach is to risk a fixed percentage of your account (e.g., 1-2%) per trade. This determines the number of units/lots to trade based on your stop loss.\n\n2.  **⚙️ Realistic Transaction Costs\n    *   Why:** With a tight 10-pip stop loss, slippage and commissions can significantly erode profitability, especially in volatile markets or during frequent trading. Ignoring these in backtesting leads to unrealistic results.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Include realistic estimates for `slippage` (e.05-0.5% per trade) and `commission` ($0.005-$0.01 per share or 0.1% per trade) in your backtests.\n\n3.  **📈 Timeframe and Instrument Specificity\n    *   Why:** While EMAs are versatile, their optimal parameters and performance can vary dramatically across different trading instruments (e.g., Forex pairs, stocks, indices) and timeframes (e.g., 5-minute, 1-hour, daily).\n    *   **Recommendation:** Clearly define the specific market and timeframe you intend to apply this strategy to. This is crucial for targeted backtesting and optimization.\n\n4.  **🧪 Robust Backtesting with Walk-Forward Analysis\n    *   Why:** Standard backtesting can lead to overfitting if you optimize heavily on a single dataset. Walk-forward analysis helps ensure your strategy is robust and performs well on unseen data.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Backtest thoroughly using `data_frequency` (e.g., 5m-1h), with `in_sample_period` (e.g., 12 months) for optimization and `out_sample_period` (e.g., 3 months) for validation. Aim for `min_trades` (>=100) for statistical significance.\n\n5.  **Exit Logic Refinement\n    *   Why:** While a fixed take profit is excellent, exploring dynamic exit methods can sometimes capture larger trends or adapt better to changing market conditions.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Consider testing a trailing stop loss, profit targets based on volatility (e.g., ATR multiples), or even exiting when the opposite EMA cross occurs, instead of just the fixed take profit.\n\n### 📊 Strategy Classification\n*   **Type:** `Trend-following`\n*   **Risk:** `Medium`\n*   **Primary Instruments:** `EMA`\n\n### ➡️ Next Steps\n*   **Review these recommendations** to strengthen your strategy.\n*   Once satisfied, you can `Approve -> Generate code` to start implementing this strategy for testing.\n\nGreat work getting to a fully defined strategy! The next phase is rigorous testing and refinement."
