  "formatted_response": "📈 Your 30/60 EMA Crossover Strategy Validation\n\nHey there! 👋 You've laid out a classic trend-following strategy using a 30 and 60-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossover, coupled with fixed stop-loss and take-profit levels. This is a great starting point for many trading systems! Let's break down the validation.\n\n### ✅ What's Clear & Well-Defined:\n*   **Clear Entry Signal**: You've specified a definite entry mechanism based on EMA crossovers.\n*   **Specific EMAs**: Using 30 and 60 periods gives us concrete parameters to work with.\n*   **Fixed Risk/Reward**: You've explicitly stated a 10-pip stop loss and a 50-pip take profit, which aims for a 1:5 risk-to-reward ratio – quite ambitious!\n\n### ⚠️ Critical Points & Gaps Identified:\n\n1.  **Stop-Loss/Take-Profit Misinterpretation**: While you clearly stated a 10-pip stop loss and a 50-pip take profit, our system seems to have **misinterpreted** these as a 'cancel' action for a step, rather than concrete risk management rules for your trades. This is why the system's internal analysis reports \"No stop-loss detected.\" **This is crucial and needs to be clarified to ensure these rules are properly applied in any backtest or live trading.**\n2.  **Aggressive Risk/Reward**: A 1:5 risk-to-reward ratio (10-pip SL, 50-pip TP) is generally high. While desirable, achieving this consistently requires a very high win rate or exceptional trend capture. It's often difficult to sustain with such tight stop losses, especially in volatile markets.\n3.  **No Dynamic Position Sizing**: The strategy doesn't include how much to trade (e.g., a percentage of capital per trade, or a fixed dollar amount). Without this, risk per trade is undefined, leading to potential overexposure.\n4.  **No Market Context**: The strategy doesn't specify which instruments (Forex, Stocks, Crypto), timeframes, or market conditions it's designed for. These factors heavily influence EMA effectiveness.\n5.  **No Additional Exit Conditions**: Beyond the fixed stop loss and take profit, there are no other exit rules (e.g., trailing stops, time-based exits, or exits based on opposing EMA crossovers), which might limit profit potential or prolong exposure unnecessarily.\n\n### 💡 Key Recommendations for Improvement:\n\nTo make this strategy robust and ready for testing, consider the following:\n\n1.  **Explicitly Re-Define Stop-Loss and Take-Profit (Priority 1 - Risk)**:\n    *   **Action**: Ensure the 10-pip stop loss and 50-pip take profit are explicitly set as active trade management rules. You might need to phrase them like: \"Set a stop loss 10 pips below entry for long trades and 10 pips above entry for short trades,\" and similar for take-profit.\n    *   **Rationale**: This ensures your risk is capped and profits are targeted. Consider testing other methods too, like using a percentage of entry price (`stop_loss_pct: 0.5-3%`) or Average True Range (`atr_multiple: 1-3x ATR`) for more dynamic stops.\n\n2.  **Model Realistic Transaction Costs (Priority 1 - Testing)**:\n    *   **Action**: Include slippage and commissions in your backtesting.\n    *   **Rationale**: With a tight 10-pip stop loss, transaction costs can significantly eat into profits, especially on frequent trades.\n    *   **Test**: `slippage: 0.05-0.5% per trade`, `commission: $0.005-$0.01 per share or 0.1% per trade`.\n\n3.  **Implement Robust Backtesting (Priority 1 - Testing)**:\n    *   **Action**: Use walk-forward validation to assess how well your strategy performs on unseen data.\n    *   **Rationale**: This helps prevent overfitting to historical data and gives a more realistic picture of future performance.\n    *   **Test**: `data_frequency: 5m-1h`, `in_sample_period: 12 months`, `out_sample_period: 3 months`, `min_trades: >=100`.\n\n4.  **Define Position Sizing (Priority 2 - Risk)**:\n    *   **Action**: Add a rule for how many units/lots to trade per signal.\n    *   **Rationale**: Controls risk per trade and overall portfolio risk. A common approach is to risk a small percentage (e.g., 1-2%) of your capital per trade.\n    *   **Test**: `risk_per_trade_pct: 1-2%`.\n\n5.  **Set Maximum Concurrent Positions (Priority 2 - Risk)**:\n    *   **Action**: Limit how many trades can be open at the same time.\n    *   **Rationale**: Prevents over-concentration in correlated assets and helps manage overall portfolio exposure.\n    *   **Test**: `max_positions: 1-5`.\n\n### 📊 Confidence in Validation: Low\n\nOur confidence in this validation is currently **low**. This is primarily due to the system's inability to fully internalize your specified stop-loss and take-profit rules, as well as the absence of other critical trading parameters like position sizing. Once these elements are clearly defined and recognized, we can provide a more comprehensive assessment.\n\n### ➡️ Next Steps:\n\n1.  **Review these recommendations** and consider how to integrate them into your strategy.\n2.  **Re-submit your refined strategy**, paying close attention to how you state the stop-loss and take-profit to ensure they are parsed as active rules (e.g., explicitly stating 'set a stop loss at X pips').\n3.  **Approve** if you'd like to proceed with code generation based on the current interpretation, but be aware of the critical missing elements.\n\nLet's get this strategy tightened up! Don't hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. Happy trading! 🚀"
