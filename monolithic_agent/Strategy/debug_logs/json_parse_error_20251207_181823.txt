  "formatted_response": "## 📈 Your EMA Crossover Strategy: Initial Validation\n\nHey there! 👋 Thanks for submitting your trading strategy. You've outlined a classic EMA crossover approach using 30 and 70 periods, which is a solid starting point for a trend-following system. Let's break it down:\n\n### ✅ What's Clear & Well-Defined\n*   **Clear Entry Signals**: You have precise rules for both long (30 EMA crosses above 70 EMA) and short (70 EMA crosses below 30 EMA) entries. This makes the strategy unambiguous for execution.\n*   **Explicit Exit Targets**: You've specified a fixed 15-pip Stop Loss and a 70-pip Take Profit. This is excellent for defining your risk and reward per trade, offering a favorable ~1:4.6 Risk/Reward ratio (70 / 15).\n\n### ⚠️ Critical Gaps & Areas for Immediate Improvement\nWhile you've done a great job defining the core logic, there are a few crucial components missing or needing clarification to make this strategy executable and robust:\n\n1.  **Missing Position Sizing 📏**: This is the most critical missing piece. Your strategy doesn't specify *how many* units (lots, shares, contracts) to trade. Without this, the strategy cannot be executed. \n    *   💡 **Recommendation**: Implement a position sizing rule, such as fixed dollar risk per trade (e.g., risk 1-2% of your account balance per trade), or a fixed number of units.\n\n2.  **Formalizing Exit Conditions 🚪**: You've stated a Stop Loss and Take Profit, which is fantastic! However, the system needs these to be explicitly linked as active *order management* rules for your open positions. Currently, the system didn't fully parse these as direct exit conditions for trades, leading to a 'No stop-loss detected' warning.\n    *   💡 **Recommendation**: Ensure your backtesting framework or execution logic applies the 15-pip stop loss and 70-pip take profit *immediately* upon entry to manage your trades effectively.\n\n3.  **Real-World Costs Matter 💸**: Transaction costs like slippage and commissions can significantly impact profitability, especially with fixed and relatively tight stop-loss and take-profit levels. \n    *   💡 **Recommendation**: Include realistic estimates for slippage (0.05-0.5% per trade) and commission ($0.005-$0.01 per share or 0.1% per trade) in your backtesting. This gives you a more accurate picture of potential performance.\n\n### 🚀 Recommended Next Steps for Robustness\nOnce the above critical gaps are addressed, consider these steps to further validate and strengthen your strategy:\n\n*   **Backtest with Walk-Forward Validation 📊**: This advanced testing method helps prevent overfitting to historical data and assesses how well your strategy performs on unseen data. \n    *   💡 **Recommendation**: Test across different market conditions and timeframes (e.g., 1-hour to 1-day data frequency, 12-month in-sample, 3-month out-sample periods, aiming for >=100 trades for statistical significance).\n\n### 🤔 What's Next?\nYour strategy has a clear foundation. Addressing position sizing and ensuring the stop loss/take profit are correctly implemented as active exit conditions are the immediate priorities. Once these are clarified, we can proceed with generating code or further refining the strategy!\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed! We're here to help you build a robust and reliable system.
