It's a classic approach, and you've got some solid foundations in place. Let's dive into the details!\n\n### 🚀 Strategy Overview\n\nYou've proposed a trend-following strategy based on two Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs): a faster 30-period EMA and a slower 70-period EMA. Here's what we understand:\n\n*   **Long Entry:** Open a long position when the 30 EMA crosses *above* the 70 EMA.\n*   **Short Entry:** Open a short position when the 70 EMA crosses *below* the 30 EMA.\n*   **Exits:** Positions are managed with a fixed 15-pip Stop Loss and a 70-pip Take Profit from the entry price.\n\n### ✅ What's Clear & Well-Defined:\n\n*   **Clear Entry Signals:** The EMA crossover for long entries is explicitly stated.\n*   **Fixed Risk & Reward:** Defining a specific pip value for your Stop Loss (15 pips) and Take Profit (70 pips) is a good start for risk management.\n*   **Simplicity:** The strategy is straightforward and easy to understand, making it a good candidate for initial testing.\n\n### ⚠️ Critical Gaps & Areas for Improvement:\n\nWhile the core idea is there, we've identified a few crucial points that need immediate attention to make this strategy executable and robust:\n\n1.  **Confusing Short Entry Logic:** Your short entry condition is stated as \"*enter short position when 70 ema crosses below 30 ema*\". This is actually the *same condition* as the 30 EMA crossing *above* the 70 EMA (your long entry). \n    *   **Correction Needed:** For a valid short signal, you typically want the faster EMA (30) to cross *below* the slower EMA (70). Please clarify this part of your strategy.\n\n2.  **🚫 Missing Position Sizing:** This is the most critical omission. Without a clear rule on *how many units/lots/shares* to trade, the strategy cannot be executed. You need to define how much capital to risk per trade or how many units to buy/sell.\n\n3.  **Missing Market Context:** To properly backtest and deploy this strategy, you need to specify:\n    *   **Instrument(s):** What currency pair, stock, commodity, etc., will you trade?\n    *   **Timeframe:** What chart interval (e.g., 1-hour, 4-hour, daily) will you use?\n\n4.  **Transaction Costs:** Realistic trading involves costs like slippage and commissions. Ignoring these, especially with tight stop losses, can turn a profitable strategy into a losing one.\n\n5.  **Lack of Exit Logic for Opposing Signals:** What happens if you're in a long trade and a short entry signal occurs? Does it close the long and open a short? Or do you only allow one position at a time? This needs to be defined.\n\n### 💡 Recommendations & Next Steps:\n\nHere are the top recommendations to strengthen your strategy and prepare it for backtesting:\n\n1.  **🎯 Define Position Sizing (High Priority):**\n    *   **Why:** You can't trade without knowing how much to trade!\n    *   **Test:** Consider a fixed dollar amount per trade, a percentage of your account balance (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade), or ATR-based sizing.\n\n2.  **Fix Short Entry Logic (High Priority):**\n    *   **Why:** Your current short entry is identical to your long entry. Correct it to be the inverse (e.g., 30 EMA crosses below 70 EMA).\n\n3.  **Include Realistic Transaction Costs (High Priority):**\n    *   **Why:** Costs significantly impact profitability, especially with fixed pips stops/targets.\n    *   **Test:** Factor in `slippage` (e.g., 0.05-0.5% per trade) and `commission` (e.g., $0.005-$0.01 per share or 0.1% per trade).\n\n4.  **Backtest with Walk-Forward Validation (High Priority):**\n    *   **Why:** Prevents overfitting and shows how your strategy performs on unseen data.\n    *   **Test:** Use historical data with `data_frequency` (1h-1d), `in_sample_period` (e.g., 12 months), `out_sample_period` (e.g., 3 months), and aim for `min_trades` (>=100).\n\n5.  **Refine Stop-Loss & Take-Profit Implementation (Medium Priority):**\n    *   **Why:** While you've defined them, ensure they are correctly implemented as immediate exit conditions upon breach.\n    *   **Consider:** What happens if an opposing signal occurs *before* SL/TP is hit? Does the trade close?\n    *   **Test:** Your current Risk/Reward is ~1:4.66 (15 pips SL / 70 pips TP), which is good. You might also explore `take_profit_pct` (1-5%), `risk_reward_ratio` (1.5-3.0), or `fixed_pips` (10-50 pips for TP) during optimization.\n\n### ➡️ Next Steps:\n\nWe recommend you **review these recommendations** and make the necessary adjustments to your strategy. Once you're ready, we can generate the code for a backtesting environment or further refine the strategy details!\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!
