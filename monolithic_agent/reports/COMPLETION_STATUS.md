## Before vs After

### Before This Consolidation
```
50+ scattered markdown files
├─ 6 setup guides
├─ 5 test reports
├─ 4 architecture docs
├─ 8 feature docs
├─ 7 troubleshooting docs
├─ 4 quick start guides
└─ Many more...

Result: Confusing, redundant, hard to navigate
```

### After This Consolidation
```
5 master documents + archive
├─ ARCHITECTURE.md       (system design)
├─ STATUS.md             (component health)
├─ SETUP_AND_INTEGRATION.md (installation)
├─ QUICK_REFERENCE.md    (quick lookup)
