## **Overview**
The AI Developer Agent is an intelligent system that generates, tests, fixes, and iterates on trading strategies automatically. It combines code generation, terminal execution, error analysis, and conversational AI into a unified workflow.

**Current Architecture**: Single Agent with Sequential Workflow
The AI Developer Agent does NOT have a traditional planner/orchestrator multi-agent system. Instead, it uses a monolithic single-agent architecture with a well-defined sequential workflow.
