  "formatted_response": "📈 Great Progress on Your EMA Crossover Strategy! 📈\n\nYou've taken excellent steps to enhance your previous 20/50 EMA Crossover strategy by addressing critical risk management and profit-taking aspects. This is exactly what's needed to move a strategy towards robustness!\n\n**Your Proposed Enhancements:**\n*   **Stop-Loss:** 15 pips below entry\n*   **Take-Profit:** 40 pips above entry\n*   **Risk Management:** Risk only 2% of your account per trade\n\n### 🤔 A Note on System Interpretation\n\nIt appears the system, in its current pass, *registered your intent* to include these vital rules but didn't fully integrate them into a structured "stop-loss" or "take-profit" step *yet*. This is why you might see some recommendations that seem to ask for what you've just provided.\n\nRest assured, adding these elements is a **significant improvement**, and we'll ensure they are properly incorporated as we refine the strategy definition.\n\n### ✅ What's Excellent About Your Additions:\n\n1.  **Defined Risk:** Implementing a fixed 15-pip stop-loss is crucial for capital preservation. You now have a clear maximum loss per trade.\n2.  **Profit Taking:** A 40-pip take-profit target helps lock in gains and prevent winning trades from turning into losers.\n3.  **Favorable Risk/Reward:** With a 15-pip stop and a 40-pip target, you're aiming for an impressive ~2.67:1 Risk/Reward ratio (40/15). This means you only need a win rate of approximately 27% to be profitable, though higher is always better!\n4.  **Smart Position Sizing:** Limiting your risk to 2% of your account per trade is a cornerstone of professional risk management. This prevents any single loss from significantly damaging your capital.\n\n### ⚠️ Current Classification & What's Next:\n\n*   **Type:** Other (This generic classification is likely because the system didn't re-parse the full EMA crossover entry *with* these new rules combined. Once fully integrated, it will revert to a more specific type like 'Trend-Following').\n*   **Risk:** Medium (The defined stop-loss and position sizing are key reasons the risk tier is now 'Medium' instead of potentially 'High' due to undefined risk).\n*   **Instruments:** Not yet specified (This will be inherited from your original strategy or clarified as we proceed).\n\n### 💡 Recommendations & Refinements:\n\nLet's ensure these rules are fully robust:\n\n1.  **Confirm Full Strategy Integration:** We need to confirm that these new risk management rules are applied *to your original 'Buy when 20 EMA crosses above 50 EMA' entry condition*. Once confirmed, the system can fully recognize your complete strategy.\n\n2.  **Dynamic Stop-Loss/Take-Profit (Optional but Recommended):**\n    *   While fixed pip values (15 SL, 40 TP) are a great start, consider if they are universally applicable across different instruments or varying market volatility. Sometimes, a stop-loss based on a percentage of the Average True Range (ATR) or a percentage of the asset price can be more adaptable.\n    *   *Test:* `atr_multiple: 1-3x ATR` for stop-loss, and `risk_reward_ratio: 1.5-3.0` for take-profit.\n\n3.  **Explicit Position Sizing Calculation:**\n    *   Your 2% risk rule is excellent. Ensure the strategy explicitly calculates the *number of units/lots* to trade based on your account size, the entry price, and the 15-pip stop-loss distance.\n\n4.  **Realistic Backtesting:**\n    *   **Include Transaction Costs:** With relatively tight stop-losses, slippage and commissions can significantly impact profitability. Always account for these in your backtests.\n    *   *Test:* `slippage: 0.05-0.5% per trade`, `commission: $0.005-$0.01 per share or 0.1% per trade`.\n    *   **Walk-Forward Validation:** To assess robustness and avoid overfitting, backtest your strategy using walk-forward analysis.\n    *   *Test:* `data_frequency: 5m-1h`, `in_sample_period: 12 months`, `out_sample_period: 3 months`, `min_trades: >=100`.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nLet's formalize these additions. Please confirm that these stop-loss, take-profit, and risk management rules are intended for your **20/50 EMA crossover entry strategy**, and we can then proceed to refine the overall validation and potentially generate code!"
